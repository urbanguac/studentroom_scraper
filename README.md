# Web Scraping forums

For the purpose of an example, one of the largest forums in the world (with almost no change in interface!) was used, called "The Student Room."
In this example, TSR is scraped on Oxford threads to search for any information regarding the MAT, USA, or anything of value to international/CS applicants.
The purpose is to replace the search function. There is no built-in search function in TSR, and although British students find it easy to navigate from experience, US and international students are at a loss without search.

##Dependencies
This was developed with everything packeged in the Anaconda python distribution. If packages are missing, please create an issue and I will see if the dependency can be packaged alongwith.
